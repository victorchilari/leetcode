## Commands after you copied this repository

### Installation

```console
yarn install
```

### Local Development

```console
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```console
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment on GitHub Pages

```console
yarn deployOnGitHub
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch. If firstly so `push` and secondly deploy, in `gh-page` will push a commit linked to the last commit from the main branch of the repository, otherwise will be linked to a commit internal for this branch.
